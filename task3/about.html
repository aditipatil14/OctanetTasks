              Dear Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO, there is no need to
              issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and sign the IPO
              application form to authorize your bank to make payment in case of
              allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain in your bank
              account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have not authorized
              anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone claiming to be
              part of Zerodha and offering such services, please
              <a href="#">create
